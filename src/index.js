// Makes the Redux store available to the connect() calls in the component hierarchy below. Normally, you canâ€™t use connect() without wrapping a parent or ancestor component in <Provider>.

// If you really need to, you can manually pass store as a prop to every connect()ed component, but we only recommend to do this for stubbing store in unit tests, or in non-fully-React codebases. Normally, you should just use <Provider>.

const router = (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Router history={history}>
      <Route path="/" component={App} />
    </Router>
  </Provider>
);

render(router, document.getElementById("root"));
