// Makes the Redux store available to the connect() calls in the component hierarchy below. Normally, you canâ€™t use connect() without wrapping a parent or ancestor component in <Provider>.

// If you really need to, you can manually pass store as a prop to every connect()ed component, but we only recommend to do this for stubbing store in unit ftests, or in non-fully-React codebases. Normally, you should just use <Provider>.
